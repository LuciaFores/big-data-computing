Whether you're a seasoned musician or a complete beginner, this is a new and intuitive way to create and experience music. In its simplest form, you just move your hands around to create unique sounds, melodies, and rhythms. There are no ‚Äúwrong‚Äù notes to worry about (as you always play in a specific scale) and you can always stay on perfect tempo with the build-in perfect timing assistant.
