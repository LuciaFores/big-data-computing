        "*   Steam is at the moment the biggest videogame store online that also provides a \"community mechanic\" for their users. The users (that arrives to be 120 million active users each month) have the possibility to create their profile not only to store the games buyed but also to share with their friends the \"achievments\" that they can get in game and more importantly they have the possiblity to leave reviews on each game on the catalogue in order to communicate their preferences to other users\n",
        "*   Steam is a highly friendly platform for developer, meaning that they provide APIs to fetch data from their website and also are not against scraping (as long as it compell the robots.txt - http://steamcommunity.com/robots.txt - of the website and is not used in order to create bots to automate transactions, spamming and so on...) meaning that is possible to collect up-to-date data without having too many restrictions\n",
        "*   If a game is distributed on PCs it will very probable that it will distributed also on Steam; beside some notable exclusive for other online store platform (i.e. Fortnite, Genshin Impact, Minecraft, ...), Steam can be saw as the most comprehensive online store (since it is not tieded to any specific publisher) in which the most of the games for PC can be found\n",

As for the recommendations is important to notice that the value could not be the same as the one that actually is on the store (meaning that there could be some games that have on the file **less** reviews than the one that are actually on the store): this is due to a limitation of the API that only get the reviews that has been written in the past 365 days from the day in which the request is made (so as it will be described later, in order to get the most of the reviews the API has not been used in favor of an ad-hoc scraper that actually is able to get more reviews)\n",

        "The aim of the project is to create a **collaborative filtering recommender system** and for this reason is important to collect the reviews not much for the specific items that the system will recommend but moreover for the specific users of the system that will later on be used in order to compute the similarities among the user that wants the recommendation and the ones that are collected in the system.\n",
        "The Steam APIs (in addition of not having the possibility to check for reviews older than 1 year from the request - which can be naturally a big problem since, excluding some games that are continuously consumed by new users, games are usally reviewed only in the few following months from the publishing) does not actually give the possibility to get the reviews starting from the users.\n",
        "In order to overcome this two big limitation an ad-hoc scraper has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "The script used to retrieve the games review starting from the users acts as following:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Import all the needed libraries\n",
        "*   Define the function that is used, given a Steam id for an user and a page number indicating a page of their *review section* on their Steam profile, will parse the HTML page got as response of the request and save **only** the reviews from the response\n",
        "*   Retrieve the previously found players\n",
        "*   For each one of the found players, the script will get all the reviews written by the players together with the needed information got from the reivew\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to notice that the saved information for each review are: **Steam id of the author** (corresponding to the *steam_id* column in the file), the **Application id for which the review has been written** (corresponding to the *app_id* column in the file), the **recommendation** given by the user for the application (can either be *Recommended* or *Not Recommended* and it's corresponding to the *recommended* column in the file) and the **amount of hours for which the user has played the game** (can be not present or present with two different values corresponding to the **total amount of time for which the user has been playing the game** and the **total amount of time for which the user has played the game at the moment of the writing of the review**; this data corresponds to the *hours_played* in the file).\n",
        "There are two important aspects that deserve to be mentioned: the first one is that it has been decided to not take in consideration the textual feedback given by the users; this is because the textual feedback is not actually mandatory in order to submit a review for a game and also because even if present the textual feedback can be actually unusefull in order to understand the feeling of the user towards the game (since it can be composed by emoticons or ASCII drawings). The second one is strictly connected to the aspect just mentioned: as already said the recommendations on Steam can only be categorized as *Recommended* or *Not Recommended* meaning the user cannot express **how much** they recommend or not a game; it's in this situation that the **hours that players spent playing the games** are helpful: by having an idea of **how much is the average time to complete a game** (which will be later explained) it is possible to convert the simple recommendation on a larger scale of grades (by taking in account how much time they spent before writing the review, if they continued playing the game after that and so on...). Naturally not all the reviews are connected to the play-time of the users (since it's possible to pla the games without having Steam collecting the user data about the gaming experience), in this case the reviews will be considered *neutral with a positive (or negative) meaning*.\n",

        "By looking at it, and comparing it with the average of the time needed to complete a game (information collected thanks to the portal *How Long To Beat* which contains the amount of time needed to complete a game) I will translate the simple positive-negative recommendations to a larger scale of grades going from 1 to 5; there are still some problems though: it can happen that a player leaves a recommendation that does not report the playtime since people can play Steam games while being offline (meaning that the service has no way to collect user information during that time) or simply because they leave the recommendation as soon as they purchase the game (CAMBIA SOPRA DOVE DICI CHE SI PUÒ FARE RECENSIONE SENZA COMPRARE); in this cases the recommendation will be considered as *neutral* (CHE VUOL DIRE? LA METTI A 3 CHE È PRECISAMENTE IN MEZZO ALLA SCALA?). Also it can happen that there are no data on average playtime on *How Long To Beat*, also in this case the reviews will be considered as *neutral* (FORSE BOH POI VEDIAMO)"
